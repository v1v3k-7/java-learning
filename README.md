# Java Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Java Practice Repository**!  
This repo contains all the Java programs I write while learning and improving my coding skills. I will keep updating it regularly with new concepts, exercises, and small projects.

## 📌 What’s Inside
- Basic Java programs  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice  
- GUI programs (Swing / AWT)  
- File handling, exceptions, collections  
- Data structures & algorithms  
- Miscellaneous practice codes  

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as:
- My personal learning space  
- A collection of solved problems  
- A reference for revision  
- A way to track my progress in Java  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/v1v3k-7/java-learning.git
2. Open the folder in your IDE (IntelliJ / VS Code / NetBeans / Eclipse).  
3. Compile and run the Java files.
